This is Ennesby.

ennesby_lock implements a Google Wave robot that prevents editing.
ennesby_translate implements a Google Wave interface to Translation Party.
ennesby_zephyr implements a Google Wave / zephyr bridge.
ennesby_zephyr[1-3] are failed versions, kept for historical reasons.

zephyr_daemon and zephyr_post are necessary for ennesby_zephyr.
conf contains Ennesby configuration.
app.yaml contains Google configuration.
ennesby and daemon are symlinks to the currently active versions,
	ennesby_zephyr and zephyr_daemon.

setup-zephyr compiles the Python zephyr library, Zephyr.c.

ennesby_* and zephyr_* must run on Google App Engine. The necessary Google
	libraries are not included. Some also depend on helpers, which is part
	of barnsnake. The exception is zephyr_daemon, which runs locally and
	requires only the zephyr library.
